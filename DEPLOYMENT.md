# Video Downloader - Render Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you deploy the Video Downloader application to Render, a cloud platform that provides easy deployment for web applications.

## Prerequisites
- A Render account (free tier available)
- This project's source code pushed to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Repository
Ensure your repository includes all necessary files:
- `app.py` - Main Flask application
- `main.py` - Application entry point
- `models.py` - Database models
- `routes.py` - URL routing
- `download_manager.py` - Download processing
- `templates/` - HTML templates
- `static/` - CSS and JavaScript files
- `render.yaml` - Render configuration (included)

### 2. Connect to Render
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign up/log in
2. Click "New" and select "Blueprint"
3. Connect your Git repository
4. Select the repository containing your video downloader

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
The application will automatically configure:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Automatically generated session key
- `DOWNLOAD_FOLDER` - Set to `/tmp/downloads` for temporary storage

### 4. Deploy
1. Click "Apply" to start the deployment
2. Render will:
   - Create a PostgreSQL database
   - Install Python dependencies
   - Start the web service
   - Set up health checks

### 5. Access Your Application
Once deployed, you'll receive a URL like: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

## Configuration Details

### Database
- **Type**: PostgreSQL (automatically provisioned)
- **Connection**: Managed via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- **Tables**: Created automatically on first run

### File Storage
- **Location**: `/tmp/downloads` (ephemeral storage)
- **Behavior**: Files are temporarily stored and automatically cleaned up
- **Note**: Downloaded files are not persistent across deployments

### Performance Considerations
- **Cold Starts**: Free tier applications may experience delays after inactivity
- **Concurrent Downloads**: Limited by available memory and CPU
- **File Size**: Large video files may hit memory limits on free tier

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build Failures**: Check that all dependencies are properly listed
2. **Database Connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL service is running
3. **Memory Issues**: Large downloads may fail on free tier
4. **Download Failures**: Some platforms may block server-side downloads

### Logs
Access logs via Render dashboard:
1. Go to your service dashboard
2. Click "Logs" tab
3. Monitor real-time application logs

### Health Checks
The application includes a health check endpoint at `/` that Render uses to monitor service availability.

## Scaling Options

### Paid Tiers
- **Starter**: $7/month - More consistent performance
- **Standard**: $25/month - Higher CPU and memory limits
- **Pro**: $85/month - Dedicated resources

### Optimizations
- Consider using cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for file persistence
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Add user authentication for controlled access
- Use CDN for static assets

## Security Considerations
- Downloads are stored temporarily and cleaned up automatically
- No user data is permanently stored beyond download history
- Session secrets are automatically generated and secure
- Database connections are encrypted

## Maintenance
- **Updates**: Push changes to your Git repository to trigger redeployment
- **Monitoring**: Use Render's built-in monitoring and alerting
- **Backups**: Database backups are handled automatically by Render

## Support
For deployment issues:
- Check Render's documentation: [docs.render.com](https://docs.render.com)
- Review application logs in Render dashboard
- Ensure all environment variables are properly set

## Alternative Deployment Options
This application can also be deployed to:
- **Heroku**: Similar configuration with `Procfile`
- **Railway**: Direct Git deployment
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Container-based deployment
- **AWS/Google Cloud**: Full cloud infrastructure

The application is designed to be platform-agnostic and should work on any Python-compatible hosting service.
